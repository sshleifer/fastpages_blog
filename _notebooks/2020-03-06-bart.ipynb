    "In October 2019, teams from Microsoft, Google and Facebook independently published three new transformer papers: UniLM, T5 and Bart. All three papers analyze found, in general that they achieve better downstream performance if they (a) replace Bert's bidirectional architecture with a seq2seq architecture and (b) Bert's fill-in-the blank cloze task with a more complicated mix of pretraining tasks. It's a fun game to try to match which of the following quotes from the abstract map to which paper:\n",
